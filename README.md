# donut_shop

I created two files, one html and one javascript to make my donut shop assignment. In my script file, my Donut Shop uses a constructor function with name, Maximum Customers per hour, Minumum customers per hour, and Average donuts per customer parameters to structure my Donut shop. I used a function with Math.floor(Math.random()) to generate a random number of customers that each donut shop gets based on the min and max customers per hour. I also made another function using Math.floor() to generate how many donuts each shop makes per customer based on the random number of customers and average number of donuts. I added each donut shop located in downtown Seattle, Capitol Hill, South Lake Union, Wedgewood, and Ballard as new shops in my donut shop constructor function and made a for loop that logs each donut shop name, customers per hour and donuts per hour to the console. Lastly I made a function in the DOM that adds a row to my table based on new information being passed in. In my html file, I created a table to mirror the table in the assignment description. And sourced my javascript file to my html as well as an id attribute to make sure the table can make new rows.

Added user input for name, minCustomers, maxCustomers, avgDonuts, hoursOfOperation. created a render function that creates new table rows. Created a submit function that creates variables based on the array. Connected these functions to my html file by filling in id attributes.
